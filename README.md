# coding-challenge-calculator-vue

What a nice coding challenge for a company i like a lot :)

Here is a small deploy for my app:
https://chuckulator.netlify.com/

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

Coding process:

1. Get Vue.js introduction and read basic docs 
2. Set up wireframes
3. Create Basic Components with minimal style, but not functionality yet
4. Add click events on each key and add logic to the calculator
