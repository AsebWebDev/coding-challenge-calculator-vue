# coding-challenge-calculator-vue

What a nice coding challenge for a company i like a lot :)

Here is a small deploy for my app:
https://chuckulator.netlify.com/

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

Coding process:

1. Get Vue.js introduction and read basic docs 
2. Set up wireframes
3. Create Basic Components with minimal style, but no functionality yet
4. Add click events on each key and add logic to the calculator
5. Polish style and fix bugs
6. Tried to deploy to Heroku, but found out that its easier on netlify
7. Add extra feature: keypress also works
